## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ Write a python program to compute the factorial for a Given Number

###  Aim
To create a Python program to compute the factorial for a Given Number

###  Algorithm

Start

Input a number a

Initialize s = 1 (this will hold the result)

Initialize counter i = 1

Repeat steps 6â€“7 while i <= a: 6. s = s * i 7. i = i + 1

Print the result s as the factorial of a

End


### ðŸ§¾ Program
a=int(input())

i=1

s=1

while i<=a:

    s=s*i
    
    i=i+1
    
print(f"Factorial of the given number {a} is {s}")
