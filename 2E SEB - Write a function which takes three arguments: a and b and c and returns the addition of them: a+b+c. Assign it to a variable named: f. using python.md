## SEB - Write a function which takes three arguments: a and b and c and returns the addition of them: a+b+c. Assign it to a variable named: f. using python

### AIM  
To write a Python program which takes three arguments: a and b and c and returns the addition of them: a+b+c. Assign it to a variable named: f. using python

### ALGORITHM
Start

Declare three integer variables: a, b, c

Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in a

Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in b

Prompt the user to enter the third number and store it in c

Calculate the sum of the three numbers: s = a + b + c

Display the result s

End
### PROGRAM
def f(a,b,c):

    s=a+b+c
    
    return s
    
a=int(input())

b=int(input())

c=int(input())

print(f(a,b,c))
